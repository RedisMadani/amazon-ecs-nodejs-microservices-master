# Comprehensive Guide: Node.js Microservices on Amazon EC2 Container Service

## Abstract

This document presents a detailed architectural guide, delineating the progression of a Node.js application. It encapsulates the journey from a traditional monolithic structure, characterized by direct deployment onto server instances sans containerization or orchestration, to an advanced, containerized microservices paradigm. This evolution is adeptly orchestrated utilizing Amazon's EC2 Container Service (ECS), showcasing the transformational approach in application deployment and management.
